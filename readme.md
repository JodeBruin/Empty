Oxtails. 
Extra-virgin olive oil.
Onion.
Celery.
Carrots.
Fresh garlic cloves. Garlic powder can also be used but I would still use fresh garlic.
Herbs. Aromatic herbs like bay leaves, rosemary and fresh thyme all work well in braises and stews.
Red wine. I used a Cabernet Sauvignon but any full-bodied red wine will work.
Tomatoes. I used canned chopped tomatoes but tomato Passata or fresh chopped tomatoes will also be delicious.
Beef broth/beef stock.
Salt and black pepper.
